Casualty IFS team provides recommendations to MCO’s that handle high exposure, risk and payout claims. 
There is a delay in identifying these claims as MCOs tend to miss claims and only refer claims at a very late stage in the process. 
Casualty IFS team would like to predict high pay out claims leveraging the adjusters’ file notes. 
The framework will help in better resolution of claims by paying what is worth and by formulating the defense plan early in Claims Process
