Flow of oracle code

1. Check count of dsm_base_payments table(generally around 18 million)
2. Check count of distinct payment id's which should be the same as the above count.
3. Check output table  for all payee employee name matches from old output.
4. Create a new table called dsm_name_match to select payment id's for all rows in which payee_employee_name_match ='Y'
5. Check count of the table(around 23000)
6. Check count of dsm_oct_output(Should be around 18 million)
7. Check count of table when source is 'DSM'
8. Check count of table when source is 'IFM'
9. Check count of distinct payment id's.This value should be the same value we got for source = DSM
10. Check all rows in the table where model score is greater than 1. This should return no values.
11. Add column d_issue_date from ewt_payment_ng to output table.
12. Verify count of output table, count of DSM rows and count of IFM rows. The count should be the same
13. Create a table dsm_oct_auth_11 with columns :
	1. Authorizers performer alpha id
	2. Authorizing performer's name
	3. Authorizing performer's title
	4. Authoritiies current record indicator
	5. All columns from output table.
Also,for all null values in the first four columns mentioned, replace with "auth not required."
14.Create a new table.Keep only distinct payment ids which are repeated more than once and where authorizing performer is involved
15. Aggregate all authorizer's alpha id's,authorizer's performer names, authorizer's title and order them by payment id and alpha id
16. Merge the new table with dsm_oct_auth_11 and update the authorizing performer alpha_id, name and title from the new table
17. Keep only distinct records
18. From dsm_oct_output table select only those records fro which issue date is from the last two months.
19. Check the counts.
20. Create new table dsm_jun_loss_exp and create new column to classify c_fin_tx_entry_type into loss payment, expenxe payment, loss payment offset, expense payment offset.
21. Check counts.
22. Create new table dsm_jun_loss_exp_2 and aggregate the loss expense indicator by grouping by payment id   
23. Check count.
24. Create new table unit_dsm_1_oct2014 and selecti issuer title, issuer name, issuer deactivation date and the difference between d_issue date and issuer_proces_ts.
25. Keep the rows where difference is the least for particular payment id and performer id.
26. Check counts
27. Add columns issuer current performer team name, and issuer title to dsm_oct_output file
28.  Check counts and for all rows where source = IFM , set performer team and performer title equal to legacy payment
29. to this table add another column with concatenated tax id's of all participants for the claim.
30. Set employe street, city,region,zip,standard address to null when employee first name and last name is missing
31. Add columns authorizers alpha id, name,title to this table and set as legacy payments for all IFM payments.
32. Add column loss expense indicator and issuer title to table
33. Add columns for payee employee name match , employee address match, payee payer name match to the table.
34. Rename all columns in the table to the appropriate names as in the tableau extract.
