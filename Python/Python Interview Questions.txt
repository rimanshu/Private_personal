Difference between genartor and iterotor:

Genrator will not print all elements in once. it will save and print from next function. Iterator will print all
element in one short. You can save ram from genrators. Genrators can be iterate only once.
To create iterator we use iter() and to generator we use function along with yield keyword
Generator uses the yield keyword. It saves the local variable
Generator in python helps us top write fast and compact code
Python iterator is much more memory efficient

Python Coding Interview Questions And Answers
Python Interview Questions # 1) How do you debug a Python program?

Answer) By using this command we can debug a python program

$ python -m pdb python-script.py

Python Interview Questions # 2) What is <Yield> Keyword in Python?

A) The <yield> keyword in Python can turn any function into a generator. Yields work like a standard return keyword.
But it’ll always return a generator object. Also, a function can have multiple calls to the <yield> keyword.

Example:

def testgen(index):
weekdays = [‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’,’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,’sat’]
yield weekdays[index]
yield weekdays[index+1]

day = testgen(0)
print next(day), next(day)

Output: sun mon

Python Interview Questions # 3) How to convert a list into a string?

A) When we want to convert a list into a string, we can use the <”.join()> method which joins all the elements into one and returns as a string.

Example:

weekdays = [‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’,’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,’sat’]
listAsString = ‘ ‘.join(weekdays)
print(listAsString)

Python Interview Questions # 4) How to convert a list into a tuple?

A) By using Python <tuple()> function we can convert a list into a tuple. But we can’t change the list after turning it into tuple, because it becomers immutable.

Example:

weekdays = [‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’,’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,’sat’]
listAsTuple = tuple(weekdays)
print(listAsTuple)

output: (‘sun’, ‘mon’, ‘tue’, ‘wed’, ‘thu’, ‘fri’, ‘sat’)

Python Interview Questions # 5) How to convert a list into a set?

A) User can convert list into set by using <set()> function.

Example:

weekdays = [‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’,’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,’sat’,’sun’,’tue’]
listAsSet = set(weekdays)
print(listAsSet)

output: set([‘wed’, ‘sun’, ‘thu’, ‘tue’, ‘mon’, ‘fri’, ‘sat’])


 
Python Interview Questions # 6) How to count the occurrences of a perticular element in the list?

A) In Python list, we can count the occurences of a individual element by using a <count()> function.

Example # 1:

weekdays = [‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’,’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,’sun’,’mon’,’mon’]
print(weekdays.count(‘mon’))

Output: 3

Example # 2:

weekdays = [‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’,’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,’sun’,’mon’,’mon’]
print([[x,weekdays.count(x)] for x in set(weekdays)])

output: [[‘wed’, 1], [‘sun’, 2], [‘thu’, 1], [‘tue’, 1], [‘mon’, 3], [‘fri’, 1]]

Python Interview Questions # 7) What is NumPy array?


 
A) NumPy arrays are more flexible then lists in Python. By using NumPy arrays reading and writing items is faster and more efficient.

Python Interview Questions # 8) How can you create Empty NumPy Array In Python?

A) We can create Empty NumPy Array in two ways in Python,

1) import numpy
numpy.array([])

2) numpy.empty(shape=(0,0))

Python Interview Questions # 9) What is a negative index in Python?

A) Python has a special feature like a negative index in Arrays and Lists. Positive index reads the elements from the starting of an array or list but in the negative index, Python reads elements from the end of an array or list.

Python Interview Questions # 10) What is the output of the below code?

>> import array
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> print a[-3]
>>> print a[-2]
>>> print a[-1]

A) The output is: 3, 2, 1

Advanced Python Coding Interview Questions
Python Coding Interview Questions # 11) What is the output of the below program?

>>>names = [‘Chris’, ‘Jack’, ‘John’, ‘Daman’]
>>>print(names[-1][-1])

A) The output is: n

Python Coding Interview Questions # 12) What is Enumerate() Function in Python?

A) The Python enumerate() function adds a counter to an iterable object. enumerate() function can accept sequential indexes starting from zero.

Python Enumerate Example:

subjects = (‘Python’, ‘Interview’, ‘Questions’)

for i, subject in enumerate(subjects):
print(i, subject)

Output:

0 Python
1 Interview
2 Questions

Python Coding Interview Questions # 13) What is data type SET in Python and how to work with it?

# *** Create a set with strings and perform search in set

objects = {“python”, “coding”, “tips”, “for”, “beginners”}

Python Coding Interview Questions # 13) What is data type SET in Python and how to work with it?

A) The Python data type “set” is a kind of collection. It has been part of Python since version 2.4. A set contains an unordered collection of unique and immutable objects.


 
# *** Create a set with strings and perform search in set

objects = {“python”, “coding”, “tips”, “for”, “beginners”}

# Print set.
print(objects)
print(len(objects))

# Use of “in” keyword.
if “tips” in objects:
print(“These are the best Python coding tips.”)

# Use of “not in” keyword.
if “Java tips” not in objects:
print(“These are the best Python coding tips not Java tips.”)

# ** Output

{‘python’, ‘coding’, ‘tips’, ‘for’, ‘beginners’}
5
These are the best Python coding tips.
These are the best Python coding tips not Java tips.

# *** Lets initialize an empty set
items = set()

# Add three strings.
items.add(“Python”)
items.add(“coding”)
items.add(“tips”)

print(items)

# ** Output

{‘Python’, ‘coding’, ‘tips’}

Python Coding Interview Questions # 14) How do you Concatenate Strings in Python?

A) We can use ‘+’ to concatenate strings.

Python Concatenating Example:

# See how to use ‘+’ to concatenate strings.

>>> print(‘Python’ + ‘ Interview’ + ‘ Questions’)

# Output:

Python Interview Questions

Python Coding Interview Questions # 15) How to generate random numbers in Python?
 
#1. random() – This command returns a floating point number, between 0 and 1.

#2. uniform(X, Y) – It returns a floating point number between the values given as X and Y.

#3. randint(X, Y) – This command returns a random integer between the values given as X and Y.

How to print sum of the numbers starting from 1 to 100? print sum(range(1,101))
